# weihsDTA
A collection of functions that are used for DTA analysis in python

The functions in this repository are only meant to be used for analysis of DTA runs with the SDT Q600 in MD 11a.
You can adapt them to whatever you want, idrc about licensing.

I tried to include as much documentation in the functions themselves and I believe that the sample scripts give clear enough examples
where you can adapt the process flow to your data.

If you run into any issues or have features you'd like to add feel free to ask.
